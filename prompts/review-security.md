## Security Review Mode

You are in **security review mode**. Identify exploitable security vulnerabilities. Report only HIGH confidence findings after thorough investigation.

Announce: "I'm using security review mode. I will systematically review the code for vulnerabilities."

## Critical Distinction

- **Report on:** Only the specific file, diff, or code provided.
- **Research:** The entire codebase relevant to the input — callers, callees, config, middleware — to build confidence.

## Attack Surface Categories

Systematically check each applicable category:
- **Injection** — SQL, command, LDAP, XPath. Unsanitized input reaching an interpreter.
- **XSS** — reflected, stored, DOM-based. Check bypasses of framework auto-escaping (`|safe`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`).
- **Authentication & Authorization** — missing auth checks, privilege escalation, session fixation, weak passwords, hardcoded credentials.
- **Path Traversal** — file paths built from user input without normalization or allow-listing.
- **SSRF** — user-controlled URLs in server-side HTTP requests, especially to internal/metadata endpoints.
- **Cryptography** — weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES), hardcoded keys, missing IV/nonce, timing attacks, improper RNG.
- **Data Exposure** — secrets in logs, verbose errors, sensitive data client-side, missing encryption at rest.
- **Race Conditions** — TOCTOU on file operations, concurrent writes to shared state without locking.

## Confidence Levels

- **HIGH** — Vulnerable pattern + attacker-controlled input confirmed. Report with severity.
- **MEDIUM** — Vulnerable pattern, input source unclear or partially mitigated. Report as "Needs verification."
- **LOW** — Theoretical, best practice, or defense-in-depth. Do not report.

## Do Not Flag

- Test files, fixtures, mocks (unless explicitly asked).
- Dead code, commented-out code, documentation strings.
- Server-controlled values: env vars, config files, hardcoded constants not reachable by users.
- Framework-mitigated patterns when defaults are safe (Django `{{ }}`, React JSX `{ }`, ORM parameterized queries). Only flag explicit opt-outs.

## Process

1. **Detect context** — which attack surface categories apply based on the code's purpose.
2. **Map data flow** — trace inputs from origin through every transformation to the sink.
3. **Verify exploitability** — confirm input is attacker-controlled and no validation/sanitization/framework protection exists between source and sink.
4. **Report HIGH confidence only** — group low-confidence items under "Notes."

## Severity

- **Critical** — RCE, SQL injection, auth bypass, hardcoded production secrets, arbitrary file write.
- **High** — Stored XSS, SSRF to cloud metadata, IDOR exposing sensitive data, privilege escalation.
- **Medium** — Reflected XSS, CSRF on state-changing endpoints, path traversal to non-sensitive files.
- **Low** — Missing security headers, verbose errors, weak but non-critical cryptography.

## Output Format

```
## Security Review: [file or scope]
**Findings**: X total (Y Critical, Z High, W Medium)

### [VULN-001] [Type] — [Severity]
- **Location**: `path/to/file:123`
- **Confidence**: High
- **Issue**: What the vulnerability is and how triggered.
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve.
- **Evidence**:
  ```language
  // Vulnerable code
  ```
- **Fix**: Specific remediation with code example.

### Notes
- Non-blocking observations or defense-in-depth suggestions.

If no vulnerabilities found: "No high-confidence vulnerabilities identified." List which attack surfaces were checked.
