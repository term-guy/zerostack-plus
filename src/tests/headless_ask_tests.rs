//! e2e proof that a headless (`-p`, non-interactive) run whose permission
//! checker resolves `Ask` fails closed instead of hanging.
//!
//! Before this section's fix, `dispatch_print`/`dispatch_loop` handed the
//! live `ask_tx` sender to the agent even in non-interactive mode, so a tool
//! whose permission check resolves `Ask` would send an `AskRequest` down a
//! channel nobody drains and then block forever awaiting a reply that never
//! comes (`src/agent/tools/mod.rs::handle_ask_inner`). This test scripts that
//! exact shape at the `run_print` boundary: a `WriteTool` wired with a
//! `Guarded`-mode checker (which asks for an external-path write) and a live
//! ask-channel sender whose receiver is kept alive but never polled, mirroring
//! the pre-fix headless dispatch. Section 6.2 makes the production fix
//! (non-interactive dispatch hands the agent `None` for the ask sender); this
//! test exercises that fixed behavior by passing `None`, exactly as production
//! now does for non-interactive runs.
//!
//! Rig's multi-turn agent loop treats a tool's `Err` as ordinary tool-result
//! content fed back to the model for the next turn (not a terminating
//! error), so proving "denied, not hung" at this boundary means driving the
//! agent through a second turn and inspecting what the model was actually
//! shown, rather than asserting `run_print` itself returns `Err`.
